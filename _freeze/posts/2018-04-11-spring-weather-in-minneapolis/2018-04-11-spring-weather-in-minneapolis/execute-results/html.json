We have gotten a lot of snow and it has been cold. To evaluate whether this is the case or whether I have hindsight bias, I pulled some historical weather data for the month of April from [Weather Underground]().\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(forcats)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(ggridges)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(viridis)\n\n# Read in data\napril = read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zief0002/Public-Stuff/master/data/april-weather.csv\")\n\n# Filter dates\napril = april %>%\n  filter(date <= 11)\n```\n:::\n\n\nI grabbed data back to 2008 (available at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zief0002/Public-Stuff/master/data/april-weather.csv). To be fair about the comparisons I was making, I filtered the data\nso that I only had the first eleven days of April for each year represented in the data. (April is a month in Minnesota that has a lot of variation from the first to last day of the month.) I then counted the number of those days each year that it snowed, as well as, the number of days over 40&#8457;, 50&#8457;, and 60&#8457;.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\napril %>%\n  group_by(year) %>%\n  summarize(\n    days_with_snow = length(grep(pattern = \"Snow\", x = events)),\n    days_over_40 = sum(temp_high > 40),\n    days_over_50 = sum(temp_high > 50),\n    days_over_60 = sum(temp_high > 60)\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 11 Ã— 5\n    year days_with_snow days_over_40 days_over_50 days_over_60\n   <dbl>          <int>        <int>        <int>        <int>\n 1  2008              4            7            3            2\n 2  2009              3           10            4            0\n 3  2010              0           11           11            7\n 4  2011              2           11            9            4\n 5  2012              0           11            9            6\n 6  2013              4            7            2            0\n 7  2014              3            8            6            4\n 8  2015              2           11            6            3\n 9  2016              3            8            2            1\n10  2017              2           11           11            4\n11  2018              5            1            0            0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis suggested that my snow hypothesis (we have had more snow this year) may be erroneous. But, we have had a couple large snows; maybe we had more snow on the days we actually had snow. To evaluate this, I computed the total amount of precipitation for the years it actually snowed during the first eleven days of April.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Get the case numbers for the days that \"Snow\" is in the event column\nsnow_days = grep(pattern = \"Snow\", x = april$events)\n\n# Compute the total amount of precipitation on the days with snow\napril %>%\n  filter(row_number() %in% snow_days) %>%\n  group_by(year) %>%\n  summarize(\n    total_snow = sum(precip, na.rm = TRUE)\n    )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 9 Ã— 2\n   year total_snow\n  <dbl>      <dbl>\n1  2008       0.96\n2  2009       0.47\n3  2011       0.08\n4  2013       1.39\n5  2014       0.81\n6  2015       0.71\n7  2016       0.06\n8  2017       0.18\n9  2018       0.82\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhile more snow than the last couple years, 2018 doesn't stand out as a banner April for the amount of snow. We will attribute this erroneous hypothesis to snow-blindness.\n\nHowever, my \"April = ðŸŒ¡\" hypothesis seems spot on. In 2018, so far, we have only had one day where the daily high temperatur was over 40&#8457;. In the 10 years previous, almost all of the first eleven days of April hit over 40&#8457;. This is compounded by the fact that the one day it went over 40&#8457;, the temperature rose to a balmy 41&#8457;!\n\nLastly, I looked at the distribution of the average daily temperatures since 2008. This was inspired by a post I saw [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/gallery.html) and [here](http://austinwehrwein.com/data-visualization/it-brings-me-ggjoy/).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Ridge plot of the distribution of average daily temperatures by year\nggplot(april, aes(x = temp_avg, y = fct_rev(factor(year)), fill = ..x..)) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(scale = 3, rel_min_height = 0.01, gradient_lwd = 1.) +\n  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.01, 0)) +\n  scale_y_discrete(expand = c(0.01, 0)) +\n  scale_fill_viridis(\n    name = expression(paste('Temp.
