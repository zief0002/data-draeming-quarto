Nationally, much as been written about the lesser proportion of males who attend post-secondary education.  Our work has disaggregated gender differences, adding other variables (e.g., race, social class, citizenship status) and types of post-secondary education where students enroll to provide a more complete picture of differences in college-going behaviors of an entire graduating class from Minnesota's public high schools.
