This post is to act as more of a reference for myself regarding the referencing for JSE articles. JSE references use the American Statistical Association's style guide which is [here](https://amstat.tfjournals.com/asa-style-guide/). 

Zotero's Style Repository includes a style file [here](https://www.zotero.org/styles/american-statistical-association).
