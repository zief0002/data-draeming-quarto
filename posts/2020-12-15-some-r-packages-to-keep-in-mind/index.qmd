I have written several notes to myself over the years as reminders. These include ideas for research, R packages I have seen and may use sometime), things to-do, etc.  I am in the process of making some of these notes more public on my blog. This will act as a more searchable, curated "note" for myself, but also makes it available to anyone else who would benefit.

## R Packages for Productivity

It can be used to compose custom email bodies based on code, code output, and markdown; and send emails using SMTP servers - even GMail - or integrate with production services like RStudio Connect.
